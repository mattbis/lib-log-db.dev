.. maybe this is a good idea i want things so simple they will never go wrong.. but not like tonsof files just a proper library type thing - its just so i gnerate a certifcate b ut i got thinking about it 

.. this is likely maybe teh core message logger of msmeo.  one day ... 

... i spend way too much time makign everything as configurable as possibel in revenge for the time spent myself.. this is is a hard habit to break.. however, the reason that happened, is you have to think about how its used.. its no good putting really important data in your own ting withouot really thinking about how useful it will be... and that in scale, it will be decent.. 

the rest is about libraries since i really like them.. 

lets say this is partly likely to happen in some form / python / rust/go whatever & nodejs and my own as small as possible ( once its finished it will be tiny to what you see ) this is why i should spend many weeks refinign how it works.. 

sinces i need it for a certifacetes
